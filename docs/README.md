# Planimation

Planimation is a modular and extensible open source framework to visualise sequential solutions of planning problems specified in PDDL. We introduce a preliminary  declarative PDDL-like animation profile specification, expressive enough to synthesise animations of arbitrary initial states and goals of a benchmark with just a single profile.

## 1 Overview 

Planimation was developed as a final year project by students at the Univeristy of Melbourne. Here's a promotional video explaining the motivation behind planimation.

Planimation is an open-source program which visualises solutions to Planning Problems. It is an executable Unity architecture in a browser.

### 1.1 Planning Problems

For information about Planning Problems, see [http://planning.domains/](http://planning.domains/)


Our application uses one 'Animation Profile' per problem domain. An Animation Profile is a user-written PDDL file which tells the Visualiser how a Domain is to be visualised. See section 3.2 for more information on Animation Profiles.


### 1.2 Scope
Planimation currently has [Animation Profiles](https://github.com/planimation/documentation/tree/master/AnimationProfiles) for four classic planning domains: Blocks, Grid, Towers of Hanoi, and Logistics. We also include Animation profiles of other classic combinatorial problems based on [Missionaries and Cannibals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem). 

Animation profiles for new domains may be added by writing an Animation Profile ([See guide](ap_guide.md)).


Planimation can animate plans generated by the AI solver available on [http://editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains). Alternatively, the user can provide their own solution from any solver, provided it conforms to the correct format.



## 2 Getting Started

1. Try planimation within the [online PDDL editor](https://tinyurl.com/yxlt96fp). Comes preloaded with files to planimat Blocks. Planimation is installable from the plugin menu.
